-- Test Script to Verify Popular Blogs Algorithm Works Correctly
-- Run this after fixing the FriendshipRepository to test friend-based recommendations

-- Create test scenario: user_001 and user_002 are friends
-- user_002 rates and saves a blog from user_001 with specific tags
-- Then check if user_002 gets recommended similar blogs when viewing popular posts

-- 1. Verify friendship exists
